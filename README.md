### Verify Installation

After installing, you can verify that both `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` are correctly installed by opening your terminal or command prompt and running:

```bash
yt-dlp --version
ffmpeg -version
```

If both commands return version information, the installations were successful.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   ./VidVortex.sh
   ```

2. **Enter the YouTube Video URL**: When prompted, paste the URL of the YouTube video you wish to download.

3. **Follow the Prompts**:
   - The script will automatically select the best video and audio formats available.
   - If the best available resolution is below 1080p, it will ask if you wish to proceed.

4. **Check Your Downloads**:
   - All downloads are saved to the "Video Downloads" folder on your desktop.
   - Logs are also saved in the same folder and will open automatically after the process completes.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permissions Denied**: If you encounter a "Permissions Denied" error, ensure you have made the script executable using the `chmod +x VidVortex.sh` command.
- **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure `yt-dlp` and `ffmpeg` are installed and accessible from your system's PATH.
